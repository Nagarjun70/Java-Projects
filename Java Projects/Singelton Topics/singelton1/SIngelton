 Singleton Class or Singleton Design Pattern
-------------------------------------------
- Singleton  class is a process of creating only one object or only 1
instance for a class.

Rules for achieving Singleton Design Pattern:
---------------------------------------------
1. Declare a private constructor. (Object creation can be done only within the same class) 

2. Declare a public static helper method, which will create an instance and returns the instance.
(helper is static because, object creation is not possible, if it is static we can access it using 
ClassName)

3.Declare a private static non primitive reference variable.


Note:
It is always a good practice to have the helper method name as getInstance().

Steps performed within the helper method:
-----------------------------------------
1. checking if the reference variable is null or not.
2.if the reference variable is null, we are creating an object & storing  it into the reference variable.
3.returning the reference variable(Object).
